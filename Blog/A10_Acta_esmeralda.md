## Conclusions
##### **1. Bernal Arellano Roberto**
The making of this part of the project was kind of hard but at the same time it was so useful. It was difficult to think about everything that our platform can and could do, thinking all the requirements to put it on our constitutive act was hard cause you can think of something that you consider is important but can miss something that was more important than the thing you think before, but all the risks, expected results, etc were necessary to complete this document that allows us to describe it and all its implications and requirements to develop a working platform and describe it to our final users and interested sponsors.
##### **2. Cisneros Acosta Jose Enrique**
When we start working in the of ​​software development area, we have the idea that it is only to develop the project but it is not like that, there are several steps that are carried out before this and one of these is the articles of incorporation, which allows us to know everything about what It will happen with our project and from there we can start the development process.
##### **3. Pimienta Castillo Kevin Aryam Christopher**
In this document it has been possible to further dimension the characteristics of the KMS system. In the process of making this constitutive act we had to work with the benefits, the high-level requirements and the milestones that seemed easy to do, but in reality we had to think very well how these elements interacted with each other.
##### **4. Sandoval Salazar Esmeralda**
In conclusion, the constitutive act is very important in the moment of making any project that we can have in mind. This is a legal document that has to be an essential part or our organizacion/enterprise documents, which means that it has all the necessary data to clarify the meaning and purpose of our organization´s project. The format of the constitutive act depends on all the requirements and type of organization that we think is needed, and we can personalize it, add or delete things that we think are needed or not.
