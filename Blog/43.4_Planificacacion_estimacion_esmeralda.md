## Conclusions 

*  **Bernal Arellano Roberto:** Making this part of the poject was so usefull. We were able to designate tasks to every member of the team based on our individual abilities. In addition, we assign tasks to each and every one of the user stories and among them we choose the ones that we consider most important, in addition to generating dependencies (within the Gantt chart) based on: "What tasks can only be done after having another one completed?"
  
*  **Cisneros Acosta Jose Enrique:** While we were doing the creation of the backlog and the Gantt chart, I realized how organized a team must be to carry out projects in comparison with each school work, apart from helping us to distribute roles and tasks to have better control of our project.
  
*  **Pimienta Castillo Kevin Aryam Cristopher:** In this practice, we estimate in hours the work unlike the past practice. As we started creating the user stories tasks, we had to further break down the components of The File Hub. I think we distribute the working hours well among the team members regarding the results of PlanITPoker.

*  **Sandoval Salazar Esmeralda:** In conclusion the sprint backlog is a more visual tool when assigning tasks to each member of the team, this aims to finish all tasks in a timely manner and that the workload for each member is less, on the other hand having a backlog sprint creates coherence and focus on the objectives of the work and encourages the team to work together and not separately.
