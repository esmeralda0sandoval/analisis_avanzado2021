## Objective
---
Make the context of the case study, as well as a field interview, and finally consolidate the requirements' information using the "emphatize" phase proposed by the design thinking methodology.

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on the provided information by the teacher about design's thinking emphatize phase, develop the indicated activity from the development's section, and if necessary make a brief investigation about **tools to collect information for the customer requirements analysis**.

* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links o another external document it must be accesed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A0.1_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**.

* As a requirement the .MD file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your GITHUB document, for example a **Link to my GitHub** and after finishing the task it must be submitted to Github.

* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** that must be uploaded to Classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.
Considering that the .PDF file was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index, which are **links to your md documents**, try not to use text to indicate internal or external links.

* It's suggested to use a structure similar to the one indicated below, however, you can use any other structure that can help you organize your repository.

1. Taking as base the characteristics referred in the case study and the design's thinking proposal, make a context, a listing of at least **15 questions to the client** that can give more detailed information to elaborate the analysis of the requirements about the case study.

### Context

### Interview
    1. What elements of design or esthetic would you like on the platform? 
    2. Which kind of user information you think is necessary to create an account?
    3. Do you think that login is needed to use the platform?
    4. Would you like the platform to have search filters?
    5. Would you like that saved topics will be available only for the user’ account or as a guest too?
    6. Which kind of files can the users share?
    7. Would you like the platform users to rate the uploaded files?
    8. If posts are made, would you like to have feedback on them?
    9. Would you like the platform to let  you add someone as  a friend to share files directly with them or all sharing methods are external?
    10. What information will the user see about the topics they have uploaded?
    11. Do you think it is important for the system to recommend documents related to the topic that the user is looking for?
    12. After the post is done, how many topics are going to be recommended? 
    13. What is the uploading files limit?
    14. Do you think it's important to have a download option for the files?
    15. Would you like to introduce a payment method to provide more (premium) options to the user?

2. Once completed the interview indicated in the previous point, use some of the suggested technics in the design's thinking emphatize phase, you can even use any other tool, technic or artifact to consolidate the collected information from the client and elaborate your **proposal of the business model of the system to be developed.**

3. Elaborate and expose your document, considering realize the dynamic as it would be done a field job or client site, and expose to the teacher and your classmates.


    ##### **1. Bernal Arellano Roberto**
    The making of this activity was so useful, not only because it helped me to know how to make an intervew, it helped too to be able to know that the system we were working on was something more like Springer than the thing i thought it was. Knowing the kind of system it is (KMS) can lead us to consider all the features that this platform can have to provide a complete platform to share, read and upload knowledge to and with other people.
    ##### **2. Cisneros Acosta Jose Enrique**
    During this activity, doing the interview, it helped me learned about the requirements and how to understand the client and how to express their ideas, I realized that the making of project isn't a easy process, the main idea is to do what the client wants and us as a programmer we have to bring what they want to life, apart from that it was a great experience having a demostration of what is ahead of us.
    ##### **3. Pimienta Castillo Kevin Aryam Christopher**
    While reviewing the answers that the “stockholder” provided to our team and the other ones, I realized that it seemed like a system that resembles a combination of pages like ResearchGate and Quora. When reasoning the answers and the characteristics of the case 3, i noticed that the system is actually a KSM system that I have never used before. The “search bar” is a tool that the system will have, and this is one of the most distinctive tools of the KSM systems. After understanding that, we begun to break down the characteristics of the system.
    ##### **4. Sandoval Salazar Esmeralda**
    Through the interviews we were able to know what content the client wants for the user and is unveiled that's what it should take, you could also see that a clear interview is always the best option for you  the interviewee answers as correctly as possible one of the complications we had when you asked the questions it was that you didn't have the clear concept but as the questions went ahead ideas ended.
